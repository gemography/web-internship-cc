# Web Coding Challenge (Internship)

## Idea of the app
Alfie has one of the weirdest cravings ever; no matter what time it is or where he is, he gets an urge to buy food as soon as possible. For someone who has never money problems like Alfie, this shouldn't be an issue. However, he cannot always remember where the nearest shop is or which are his favorite ones, which makes it hard for him to satisfy his appetite.

Your task is to implement an app that allows people like Alfie to see the list of all the nearby shops, as well as to keep track of their favorite ones.

## Application Data

A MongoDB dump with ~300 shops is provided. To import the data, you need to extract the zip file then execute the command below :
 

    mongorestore --db shops shops/

‚Üí‚Üí A shop database will be created with a shops collection.

‚Üí ‚Üí Dump File : [here](dump-shops.zip)



## How we'll evaluate üö®
- Your code will be evaluated based on: code structure, programming best practices, legibility.
- The git commit history will be also evaluated.
- Do not forget documentation. Or how are we going to evaluate your work if we can't init the project on our machines?
- Put more focus on code quality and less on speed. Don't hack something quickly, take your time and craft something clean.

## Questions?

Asking questions is highly recommended in this exercise. Do not assume anything!
